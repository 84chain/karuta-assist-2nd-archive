# karuta-assist-2nd-archive
An archive for the 2nd instance of the karuta assist bot


Due to recent slash command changes made by Discord and Karuta, I have decided to permanently disable my bot.
I am sure this comes as great sadness for all 0 of you users out there, but it is what it is.

However, all the code is still here, so if anyone wishes to run this bot again, feel free to edit the code attached and start up a new bot.
There's a catch, you have to credit me for the original code and sheet.

Due to popular demand, I will release a view-only version of the sheet, if anyone wishes to restart the bot on their own, feel free to contact me either through Discord (84chain#5753) or by email.

[Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXlctktCfqP7NF5kvj4sP2OwIx2MhkyK6phJLQf_j_U/edit?usp=sharing)

A quick explaination on the sheet:
- The urls for the characters are truncated, because all editions of a character share the same dating preferences, but do not share the same url
- Ids are made public, but probably do not pose a threat
- The dyes are also all publicly found on public and large Karuta servers.

If any possibility of compromised data occurs, let me know so I can remove those columns from the sheet.

It's been a great time over the past 2(?) years, love you all.

(Lmk if you want me to release an archive for the 1st instance of the bot as well)
